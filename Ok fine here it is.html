    <p>Hey, sorry about this... ;-; If you can get past the music probably blaring out right now, I have a very serious topic to talk about. Recently I've become badly injured again, and I just haven't been able to get it out today.<br>
    So yeah, it's another rickroll. Consistency and all, huh? But, basically, I'm asking you all for an extension. I know this isn't ideal, and I'm so, so embarrassed, but I promise that I'll get it out as soon as possible... Isaac, over and out...</p>
    <p><br><br>thanks to this <a href="https://github.com/IsaacTFM">epic dude</a> for originally rickrolling us all, Alright thats all me has 2 say soo...<br><br>You guys know the rules, and so do I, SAY GOODBYE</p>
